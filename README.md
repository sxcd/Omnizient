# Omnizient: Deep File Search For the Android filesystem

Hi fellow code wranglers! Welcome to Omnizient, my pet project on trying to fix local search for Android. 


P.S: Not to dissapoint you, but it doesn't run yet and has a ton of issues I'm trying to iron out. Gimme some time please.

## What's This All About?

Imagine you're trying to find that one meme you saved three years ago, buried somewhere in the digital abyss of your Android device. Frustrating, right? Well, fear not! Omnizient is here to save the day (or at least try really hard not to make it worse).

This app is my playground for learning Kotlin and Android development. A fancy file search engine might've been too much tbh. But yes it's based on a very real problem statment with Andorid devices. 
When you have apps like Whatsapp and different browsers pooling in files from everywhere, it gets insanely hard with the average file manager to seek them out. I'm trying to fix that and build a local content aware search engine, not attached to any file manager.

## The Grand Plan (a.k.a. Objectives)

1. **Search Like a Pro**: Find files faster than you can say "Where did I put that?"
2. **Deep Dive**: Eventually implement advanced semantic search.
3. **Web UI Magic**: Control your searches from a web browser.
4. **Learn Stuff**: Figure out Kotlin and Android dev without losing my sanity (fingers crossed).

## Progress Report

So far, we've got:

- A basic UI that has a long way to go.
- Basic file searching that is buggy at the time of writing this.
- A web interface that actual isn't too shabby.
- Some cool Kotlin coroutines magic happening under the hood.

## The Road Ahead (Lots of Potholes)

Here's what's in line, and it's a really long line:

1. **Semantic Search**: Teaching the app to understand full context of files it's dealing with.
2. **File Preview**: See what's inside files without opening them, like X-ray vision for your documents (Ideally text contents)
3. **Performance Boost**: Longterm app performance optimization.

## Wanna Join the Fun?

I have no idea why you would want to work on this at this stage. But if you do, suit youself.
Just remember, this is a learning project, my ego is still fragile

## Final Thoughts

Building Omnizient has been a wild ride so far. It's taught me a lot about Kotlin, Android, Gradle, SQLite, MVC, DAO Design Pattern and the importance of caffeine in software development.
Who knows where this journey will take us next? Maybe we'll end up creating the next big thing in file search, or maybe we'll just have a good laugh along the way.

Either way, thanks for stopping by! Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some more code to wr... I mean, bugs to create.
